# Arduino Experiments

Source files for various Arduino experiments I am working on to learn hardware programming. Definitely a new frontier for me as I hop between software and hardware realms.

## Projects

### DHT11 Sensor

- Makes use of the [DHT Library from Ada](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
- The sensor measures temperature and humidity
